              After the birds invaded the world in 1963 for the first time, 60
              years later they have come back stronger than ever. Now they have
              mutated and the birds are much more aggressive. Hitchkock has had
              no choice other than to resurrect himself and attack them aggressively.
              <br />
              Do you think Hitchcock can make all the birds disappear this time?

              The rules of the game are easy for Hitchcock. This time he has a
              boomerang in his hands, it is his only weapon at the moment. 60
              years later, various types of birds have appeared, some more
              aggressive than others, Hithcock will have to discover them.
              What kind of weapons will the birds surprise him with this time?
              If Hitchcock wants the birds to dissapear forever, he needs to kill 50 birds this time.
